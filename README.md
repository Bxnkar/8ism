## 🕯️ What is 8ism?

**8ism** is an **AI-powered Augmented Reality companion** designed to help **autistic children** navigate daily routines, emotions, and social interactions —  
**through a calm, friendly entity that exists between reality and imagination.**

Inspired by the **Lord of the Mysteries (LOTM)** aesthetic,  
8ism feels like a **benevolent Sealed Artifact** —  
an ever-present guide that **never judges, never rushes, and never overwhelms.**

## 🔮 Core Philosophy

- 🕊️ **Low-Stimulation First** — no sudden sounds, harsh colors, or pressure
- 🧠 **Observe, Don’t Command** — the system adapts to the child, not vice versa
- 🎭 **Emotion as Knowledge** — feelings are signals, not problems
- 🕯️ **Rituals Over Tasks** — routines are calm, repeatable ceremonies

leading children through small “rituals” that feel safe and familiar.

- Speaks slowly and clearly
- Uses gestures more than words
- Rewards effort, not correctness
