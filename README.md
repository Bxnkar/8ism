## 🕯️ What Is 8ism?

**8ism** is an **AI-powered Augmented Reality companion** designed to assist  
**autistic children** in navigating:

- Daily routines  
- Social interaction  
- Emotional recognition  

It does so **not as an assistant**,  
but as a **gentle, ritual-like presence** —  
a calm entity that exists **between reality and imagination**.

8ism does not command.  
8ism does not rush.  
8ism waits.

</p>

Inspired by the **Lord of the Mysteries (LOTM)** universe,  
8ism follows a **Benevolent Entity Doctrine**:

🕯️ **Low Stimulation Over Excitement**  
🕯️ **Observation Over Instruction**  
🕯️ **Ritual Over Task Lists**  
🕯️ **Emotions as Signals, Not Errors**  

The child adapts at their own pace.  
The system adapts faster.
